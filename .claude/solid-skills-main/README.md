# Solid Skills

Professional software engineering skills for AI coding agents. Transforms code into senior-engineer quality software through SOLID principles, TDD, clean code practices, and professional software design.

Skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) format.

## Available Skills

### solid

Transform junior-level code into senior-engineer quality software. Primarily designed for **TypeScript** and **NestJS** projects, but applicable to any object-oriented codebase.

**Use when:**

- Writing any code (features, fixes, utilities)
- Refactoring existing code
- Planning or designing architecture
- Reviewing code quality
- Debugging issues
- Creating tests
- Making design decisions

**Core principles:**

| Principle | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| TDD | Red-Green-Refactor cycle, tests before code |
| SOLID | Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion |
| Clean Code | Meaningful names, small functions, no comments needed |
| Design Patterns | Creational, Structural, Behavioral patterns |
| Architecture | Vertical slicing, dependency rule, clean architecture |

**Reference documentation included:**

- `solid-principles.md` - SOLID principles with TypeScript examples
- `tdd.md` - Test-Driven Development practices
- `testing.md` - Testing strategies and patterns
- `clean-code.md` - Clean code guidelines
- `code-smells.md` - Code smell detection and fixes
- `design-patterns.md` - GoF patterns with examples
- `architecture.md` - Clean architecture principles
- `object-design.md` - Object stereotypes and responsibilities
- `complexity.md` - Managing essential vs accidental complexity

**Key features:**

- Enforces TDD workflow (write failing test first)
- Detects and fixes code smells automatically
- Applies SOLID principles to every class and function
- Uses value objects for domain primitives (IDs, emails, money)
- Follows Law of Demeter and Tell Don't Ask
- Keeps methods under 10 lines, classes under 50 lines

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add ramziddin/solid-skills
```

## Usage

Skills are automatically available once installed. The agent will use them when relevant tasks are detected.

**Examples:**

- "Implement a user registration feature"
- "Refactor this service to follow SOLID principles"
- "Review this code for quality issues"
- "Add tests for this module"
- "Design the architecture for a payment system"
