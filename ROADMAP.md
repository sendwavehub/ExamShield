## Post-v1.0 — Under Consideration

These are ideas not yet committed to any milestone. Open a Discussion to advocate for one.

| Idea | Notes |
|---|---|
| GraphQL API | Complementary to REST, not a replacement |
| Offline-first mobile with local DB sync | SQLite on device, sync on reconnect |
| ML-based handwriting recognition | Beyond bubble sheets — free-form answers |
| Blockchain-anchored audit log | Timestamping via Bitcoin or Ethereum OP_RETURN |
| QR-code visible stamp on captures | ✅ Implemented — QrStampService overlays a scannable QR (captureId + examId + hash prefix) in the bottom-right corner of every stored image |
| Multi-tenant SaaS mode | Multiple exam boards on a single cluster |
| Biometric invigilator verification | Face match at capture start |
| Federated learning OCR model | Train without exposing raw answer sheets |
